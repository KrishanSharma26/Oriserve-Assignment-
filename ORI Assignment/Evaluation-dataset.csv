Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time slot for me. Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time for fitting provided for me. The actual fitting took a bit longer than expected. Apparently this was due to one of the new tyres not inflating on the rim.

"I've used [REDACTED] previously several times for tyre purchase and fitting for three of my cars and each time the service has worked seamlessly and very efficiently. On a previous occasion, I needed to contact their CS dept. and was rapidly and properly served by a helpful, professional and friendly UK agent. Lots of companies could potentially sell tyres only online but [REDACTED].com also have the UK national fitting service options fully covered. So each time, as now, I purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com and ordered a fitting service from ATS Euromaster at our branch in Knutsford (incidentally those friendly guys there, Mark & Andy, are always excellent and bang on time). The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element. So they tick every box, imho. Did I miss anything?!

The process of choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me. The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms. The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know. Prices are slightly cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.

Got to fitters, which was only 15-20 minutes away, showed my order & they got started on it within 10-15 minutes. The staff at the garage were very friendly, listened to my instructions regarding which tyres needed changing & changed them quickly & efficiently.

Having done it now ill always do it this way. [REDACTED] is really easy to use & you can see lots of different makes of tyres & most importantly reviews & ratings on each tyre. Once you've chosen what & how many you want it gives you fitting locations & time slots (fitting included in the price) so you choose your most convenient location & time for fitting. The tyres get delivered to your chosen location, you rock up at the allotted time, they get fitted, job done. Great price too. Ill definitely use [REDACTED] again & can thoroughly recommend them.",ease of booking positive,tyre quality positive,location positive,extra charges positive,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,
First time using [REDACTED]. Website was quick and easy to use. Plenty of tyre choice with specs of each listed along with noise of the tyre.

Bad experience this time. Garage didnt balance wheels properly. Took car back and they rebalanced- car was even worse. I drove 500 miles to Scotland with a wobbly steering wheel. A [REDACTED] dealer in Scotland has hopefully sorted it today. I complained and to date no one at [REDACTED] has resolved my complaint after a chase up email sent yesterday. Poor service. However this is the first time I’ve had an issue like this hence I’ve awarded a 5 not a 0 which frankly is all you deserve on this showing !!,advisoragent service negative,response time negative,balancing negative,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,

"Initial appointment delayed due to courier losing one of my tyres, rescheduled appointment was not suitable for me as I required my car for that time to travel over 100 miles, which I explained in my email, I was emailed back saying it was the earliest appointment I could get. This resulted in me then phoning during my working hours, to be told I could get my appointment changed to the following day after my initial one, which was more suitable. I was also told the missing tyre would be tracked to make sure it was delivered the following day. Lunchtime the following day my appointment was changed again but to the day after I required my car for! This again resulted in me having to make another phone call and to be told my second tyre was not yet delivered but should be at the site that afternoon. I managed to get the third appointment which was confirmed the day before back, explaining that I needed at least one of the tyres changed. I dropped off my car the following morning at around 7.45 am to be told the second tyre had not yet arrived. My appointment was not until 2.00 pm, but one of the reasons I dropped it off earlier was to ensure the message about needing at least one of them to be done had been relayed appropriately from your company. I was told this was done however was struggling to believe that after being told 2 days before that my tyre would be tracked to ensure it was delivered in the following day. The overall experience was quite stressful. I have used this site before in 2018 and had no issues on that occasion.

Garage did not appear to know I was due to have tyres fitted.They asked for a couple of hours so I left my car. Went back 2.5 hours later still not done and was asked to wait another 30 mins. I wanted 4 new tyres as I had kerbed 3 of my wheels which are to be repaired on 29th August so had new tyres fitted before repairs as getting tyres fitted usually caused damage to wheels..well they damaged my only undamaged wheel so now I am getting all 4 repaired an extra cost of £130.,garage service negative,wait time negative,length of fitting negative,damage negative,,,,,,,,,,

This I did (now one day before my holiday). My wife took the car to the garage at 0930 on the rescheduled date to be told the tyres still weren't available. After many conversations with customer service, identical tyres were sourced and fitted at 1630. No-one seems to know what happened to the original pair.

I ordered my tyres they got delivered and also got fitted - however when I arrived for my appointment I got asked who booked the car in by the manager I believe he told me they had advised [REDACTED] to cancel appointments as they were short staffed and double booked. I then said I would leave my car and comeback in a hour - when arrived back a hour later my card had not moved eventually my car went into the workshop about 10.45 I had a hospital appointment at 12.00 I checked on the progress of my tyres being fitted at 11.15 and found the wheels still hadn’t been removed. At that point I left the garage as I needed to be at my hospital appointment. I then had to make arrangements to get to the hospital and also to get back to collect my car I arrived back and my car was done. I understand this is not something you have any control over however the garages you use should be audited as I was not the only customer who wasn’t happy on that day- I also understand how garages work as I worked as a service manager in a main for 25 years I am not disappointed in the service received from you however very dissatisfied with your agents you choose to use .,garage service negative,wait time negative,booking confusion negative,,,,,,,,,,,

The first & last time I will ever use you. I am still waiting for my tyres to be done. You took £190+ from my account straight away. You then cancelled the first job.

Wiltshire Tyres then called me that morning to say they had to chase YOU up as YOU had not re-booked my tyres with them. Wiltshire Tyres then called me again today as they were due to come to my house tomorrow 9am-1pm.

Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,garage service negative,location positive,ease of booking negative,value for money negative,damage negative,length of fitting negative,,,,,,,,

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",damage negative,garage service negative,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,,,

"Having a BMW with staggered wheels it's very difficult to find x 2 pairs of the same tyre in the same place. I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture. The annoying thing was, the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so I had to bite the bullet and change all 4. [REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error. The tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in Lincoln. F1 Autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to Holiday on time.

"Firstly, my tyre was not available on the day I booked. The day before my appointment, I was contacted as the delivery could not be made by the allotted time. This seems like rather poor planning on [REDACTED]' part. I had to change my weekend plans and miss an important event because I couldn't drive the long distance on my tyre that needed to be replaced. Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst). Having chosen one, when I went to the business on the day, no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location, or in the second location I was sent to. Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change. The booking system appeared robust and I was pleased with the price, the people at the garage were courteous and the service provided at the garage was good, but the above two points really annoyed me.",garage service positive,late notice negative,delivery punctuality positive,booking confusion negative,no stock negative,value for money positive,delivery punctuality negative,,,,,,,

"AVOID [REDACTED] their mobile fitting service. On Sunday (04/08/2019) we had paid and booked for a tyre to be fitted on Wednesday (07/08/2019)We had been given the option of an AM or PM booking (no time specific) We chose an AM booking. Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived. My partner rang [REDACTED] and she said that an AM booking is anywhere between 9AM &1PM. 1:30PM and the fitter still hadn't arrived. She waited an hour and rang [REDACTED] back, after a few back and forth phonecalls they said the fitter was stuck in traffic, and possibly wouldn't be able to get to her till after 5PM.My partner suggested they came to our house after 5pm as this really needed doing and we had aleady been let down 3 times, [REDACTED] gave us the number of the fitter so we could contact him.5:15PM and still no sign of the fitter at home.

"Great prices appalling organisational skills Would not use again. I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with.

I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.",balancing negative,damage negative,extra charges negative,garage service negative,length of fitting negative,refund timescale negative,,,,,,,,

booked to have 2 tyres fitted confirmed booking then was told that the garage didnt have the right equipment for a 19 inch wheel worse excuse i have ever heard then booked it into another garage saturday who then couldnt fit 2 tyres due to 2 being run flats so ordered another 2 for a thursday fitting then received a e-mail wedsenday night at 17.27 saying that they cant fit the tyres with no time left to call you as you closed at 17.30 surly a phone call would have been better as i had taken the day off work to arrange this then after a call to yourselfs they infact did have the tyres but if i never chased it up in the morning i would have lost another 3/4 days so took almost 2 weeks to get a set of tyres fitted so i wont be using your service again and im afaid i wont be recomending your service,ease of booking negative,change of date negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

I assumed this meant it was booked.The next day I received an email and text saying to contact [REDACTED] urgently - which I did - I was told I couldn't have the appointment I had booked and on asking for an alternative appointment that day I was told there were NONE available - they were fully booked. I asked why I had received an email and was told that isn't a confirmation!I was then told I could have an appointment on Thurs at ANY time - I opted for 11:00am although I could have done any time... I was contacted about 10mins later to be told there were NO appointments for the WHOLE of thursday... why offer me any time iwanted if i wasn't able to get any appointment ??By this time I just wished I'd never paid for the tyre and had tried elsewhere - I was then told I could have any time Friday!! I said I was working on Friday and wouldn't be able to ge tto the garage until 15:30....they shut at 16.00! ...but I was told I could have that time.I arrived at the garage early and they said they could do my tyre now...but when they went to look they said they didn't think the tyre had come as there was nothing in my name...As I was about to explode they said they had a tyre not in my name that they could fit now.After explaining my frustrating experience to the guy in the garage he said if i'd called them directly on Monday - they could have done it that afternoon!!!!... although they probably couldn't compete with the price - he looked for me and it would have cost £6 more!!! I probably would have paid £40 more!! NOT because i wanted to but for the convenience and lack of stress i had to endure dealing with [REDACTED].If in the beginning I'd been told i couldn't have it done until Friday i would have been frustrated but it would have been my choice wether i continued with the purchase or went elsewhere - but to be mucked about and having to reschedule appointments etc....i DEFINITELY will NOT be using them again or be recommending them to anyone else",change of date negative,delivery punctuality negative,garage service positive,booking confusion negative,advisoragent service negative,value for money negative,,,,,,,,

Purchasing tyres was easy. Getting them fitted was a complete nightmare.- 14/08. Arrived at 7.45am for an 8am fitting. I left the garage at 11am. I complained at the timeabout the time it took took replace the 4 tyres. - 15/08. Started vehicle at 7.30am to drive to work. Tyre pressure warning light came on so checked tyres. Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire. Brake Pads and discs replaced by BMW in March and was advised by BMW that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed.Im not one to complain. However all the above are unacceptable.I will be pursuing this......,garage service negative,damage negative,length of fitting negative,,,,,,,,,,,

"A bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat. A bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience I'm afraid, so lower rating than I anticipated. Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great.

"[REDACTED] only delivered three tyres to the garage instead of four for the following day fitting which had to be cancelled.

So another half day booked and what another late email saying can’t actually get hold of tyres? I rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which I refused. I explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost £20 more for each tyre, could this be the reason? Who knows, anyway I had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work.

Not surprising when I inspected the 'Dot Date' and it was 4517 (ie tyres manufactured in week 45 of 2017.Queried this with [REDACTED] who told me that they have many different suppliers and do not check the age of the tyres.They could re-order but no guarantee that the replacements would be any newer.

No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price. Very poor service to be told just before fitting time the order could not be fulfilled.

Ordered on-line and gave details of my standard vehicle. Arrived for mid-morning appointment to be told that none of the equipment was capable of lifting it. The staff were critical of their boss who had supplied them with innapropriate lifting equipment which they don't use. Having already paid for the tyres + fitting I had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the Motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon.. Wasted my day.There's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase. If in doubt I suggest you contact your local [REDACTED] prior to ordering on-line to save a wasted journey.

Wheel nuts were put back with air gun but checked after with torque wrench which begs question what torque was put on by air gun....I have since loosened and re-torqued the nuts....I gave the torque settings.Wheel nuts were done up in a circular way i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of opposites i.e. 1, 3, 4, 2....basic knowledge lacking which does not give confidence for any other action that may have been required.Free tracking check.....he did not make sure rack was centralised....good job I did. Garage does not have Castor/Camber checking equipment....surely a must in these days of bad potholes to check suspension alignment for new tyres.Perhaps it was unfortunate the senior was busy with a rep at the time.",response time positive,delivery punctuality positive,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,,

After being given a fitting date when the order was placed I then received an email saying that it would be pushed out by an additional 2 days due to unforeseen problems. This email was sent after closing hours so I couldn't make contact to try and resolve the issue sooner. I then had to call back then next day numerous times to find a solution. It turned out that it was simply because the arrival of the tyres hadn't been confirmed with the fitting centre. Turns out tyres were there after all and they could be fitted on the requested day but by this point not until lunchtime and I'd had to take time off work to get this sorted and done.,ease of booking negative,delivery punctuality negative,change of date negative,,,,,,,,,,,

They guys on my 3rd visit were very nice but explained that the rim had not been prepared/ cleaned properly on the first fit nor was there enough sealant which is what caused the leak.

Better if [REDACTED] mentions Tyre Thread Depth.

But when I looked at the rear tyres I strongly felt they were only slightly better in depth than my old tyres but i didn't raise issue when got them fitted.

Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them.

They finally agreed not to charge me extra so I asked about tracking but they would only do that if i replaced both front tyres and they would charge extra for that on top of the normal price for tracking. I declined that and went else where for the tracking. There was a young boy changing the tyres who moved so slow and kept yawning.,garage service negative,value for money positive,extra charges negative,,,,,,,,,,,

I contacted [REDACTED] customer service by email to try and resolve this but didn't get a reply, meaning I had to take my car to a separate service centre and pay an additional £38 to get the four wheels balance.

"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent.

The fitters, Harris Bros, said that I should have had a different version of the tyre ordered. Also I have noticed that the fitters check tracking and ask if you need it altered - at a price.

"DisappointingMy review reflects the individual garage that put the tyres on my car. I phoned in advance to give my arrival time and was told it was quiet. I arrived exactly when I said I would and was told it was terribly busy! I waited a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes (the actual fitting time on my car took less than 15 minutes). The waiting room was dingy and dirty, the magazines elderly and torn, the coffee machine was out of cups and coffee pods. I did not try the loo as I was put off by the waiting room. I won't go there again but may try another fitter or the home fitting option. Hard to tell how much I saved as I chose tyres that my previous supplier does not stock; also I always used to get a wheel alignment with them and did not do that at this garage.",length of fitting positive,wait time negative,facilities negative,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,

Tyres good price and fitting good too. Down side... I added a two wheel tracking to order but the garage charged me more for it as they said they don’t do a 2 wheels tracking and had to have a 4 wheels alignment.

I had a booking at 10.30am. I turned the fitters said it would take 1.5Hrs to fit the tyres on my car as it was a Tesla. I have had tyres fitted before only took around 30min. they were extremely busy. based on this I got a taxi to my brother's because what was I going to do for an hour and a half. I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there. I had to go back again and waste another 10-20 minutes while they looked for my tyre. It screwed up my day as I needed to do things/ shopping before we departed by car to France on Sunday morning.,garage service negative,wait time negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

They offered to order them in but I’d not be able to collect the car until the end of the day as the tyres wouldn’t arrive until 4pm.This was nothing worse than an inconvenience, but given that the price paid was identical to ATS fitted price (but they had a deal on when you bought two tyres) and in actual fact £20 more expensive that Kwik Fit, I regretted automatically going to [REDACTED] based on previous experience.",value for money negative,delivery punctuality negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Garage Was Great [REDACTED] Wasnt. Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!..

"The company that only puts itself first never the customer. Was given unacceptably last minute notice my tyres were not going to be delivered and ready for fitting, -despite the fact I had taken time off work for this appointment in advance (and could not reclaim that day of holiday with such short notice). [REDACTED] have remained totally unappreciative of that lost holiday and great inconvenience. Indeed they have made no acknowledgment of this complaint whatsoever -that is how much they respect customers and value a customer's time. [REDACTED] have a diabolical level of customer care that not only completely ignores any complaint you might make or loss suffered, but also will take atleast 24 hours to offer you any response at all (making rescheduling even more inconvenient). I had to schedule the appointment myself directly with the fitter as [REDACTED] proved utterly redundant as any support or help in this way. It was then my horror to experience their recommended fitter (Johnsons Motors) jack up my car incorrectly (despite my clear and polite request the fitter confirm with me where to jack my car before raising it). I had to shout at the unresponsive engineer to lower my car immediately upon noticing (only by chance) their incompetence. The fitter then proved argumentative, dishonest before shouting their refusal to do any further work at all -despite the fact the work was already paid for via [REDACTED]. I have made yet another complaint to [REDACTED] for this further diabolical low level of quality product and customer service offered via their company -who have again sought to ignore this complaint as well. They have also so far ignored my fair and rightful request of a full refund. Without any service, any real communication and no product honoured, -I am now considering legal action to recover my funds and potential losses from damages.

"Do not use Very poor customer service. Yes, the tyres they sell are at a more competitive price than the manufacturer of my car however their customer service is appalling. I spent almost £300 on new tyres and booked a fitting slot for the Wednesday the following week only to receive an email literally 24hrs in advance saying there was a delay on my order. There was no explanation for the delay and they rebooked me a new slot without even phoning me to discuss a suitable day. As a result I had to take a day off work to accommodate this as I couldn’t postpone the fitting any longer. I replied to their customer service teams email stressing my dissatisfaction to never receive an explanation or compensation for the delay.

Totally unacceptable. It was too late to contact [REDACTED] then so we phoned Saturday morning and was told the fitter would come that morning as arranged. We agreed to that but said we had to travel to Manchester at lunchtime. No-one had turned up by 11.45 so we phoned again and was told fitter would be with us by 1.00-1.15. Still no show, so phoned again at 2.00pm and was told he would be with us by 3.00pm. Still no show so we left home, making alternative travel arrangements and being disappointingly late for the event we had planned. Rang [REDACTED] again Monday morning and was told fitter would come at 1.00pm. He finally arrived at 3.45 that afternoon.

"I've used [REDACTED] several times over the last 10 or so years. My car, my wife's car and our motorhome. On every occasion I saved money and the choosing and fitting process was simple. One fitting centre (also a tyre supplier of course) had quoted me about £150/tyre, compared with £120 from [REDACTED]. They were then the fitting centre that I chose, so they made a small profit from the fitting but nothing from the supply.

"Excellent prices and service.I have used [REDACTED] several times over recent years. I require quality high performance tyres and they have ALWAYS been the lowest price compared to all other suppliers online. On the most recent purchase I had an issue ( not BC’s fault, but my own error ) and they contacted me as I requested and they resolved the issue I had straight away - how customer service should be. I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - I’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality. Out of curiosity I asked the recent fitting centre I had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if I bought the tyre from them. I was surprised to hear that their fully fitted price for the exact same tyre would have been £75 more ! I have no hesitation in recommending them to others - I hope they don’t allow their prices to rise, they remain competitive, and their customer service standards stay high.",value for money positive,advisoragent service positive,tyre quality positive,extra charges positive,,,,,,,,,,

Mainly because when my wife turned up at the garage with my 3 year old son the garage had only been sent 3 of the correct tyres. So my wife had to wait for an hour before the 4th tyre arrived.

"Surprisingly Poor Service. I've used [REDACTED] many times in the past and have been really pleased with the value for money and customer service. It therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion.Everything seemed fine at first, my order went though and I was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a Saturday morning. Later that day I received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the Saturday, that was slightly annoying but OK, I replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following Tuesday would be fine.The next day I receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following Tuesday, bearing in mind that it's only Friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date. Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled. There was no apology, no explanation, nothing in their email.I really am confused as to why [REDACTED] would think I should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family.

Agreed to have them fitted myself, if they deliver to the billing address. Was lied to and told 3-5 days. One of the 4 original tyres is damaged and so its unsafe to continue driving, so i've rented a car for the 3-5 days. Despite knowing this. Communication is lacking. Tyres haven't arrived 2 weeks after ordering. Emails aren't being replied to. Terrible customer service. Havent been refunded yet on the installation costs which weren't provided. Can't get my head around how poor the buying experience has been.

"2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around. The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ? Not impressed. I will use [REDACTED] again, but not, to name names, ATS.

Tyres fitters let me down as tyre encountered 35 to 20 bar pressure drop whilst getting keys. Upon notifying them they didnt think anything of it and it dropped to flat at home and I had no spare rim tyre. Had to drive flat on new tyres and a crack was in the alloy .

"Had an awful experience. The tyres are great goodyears so can't really go wron [REDACTED] need to take more car when selecting garages to fit there tyres. The issues I have is with the garage who fitted the tyres david duthie motors peebles they have chipped, scratched and made gouges round the rims. When I contacted the garage ( David duthie motors ) peebles they said the alloys are corroded they do have small areas of corrosion and not the cause of the damage there are even Mark's on the centre of the wheel where it has been secured to the machine.I have myself been in the automotive trade for over 20 years and in my early days fitting tyres if I had damaged a customers alloys like they have mine I would have offered to repair them without question. I think its ridiculous a so called [REDACTED] authorised installer can treat a customer like this. Safe to say I will never set foot in this garage again i won't be recommending david duthie motors peebles to anyone in fact I'll be telling my family and friends to go elsewhere, due to this experience probably never use [REDACTED] again.",garage service negative,damage negative,tyre quality positive,,,,,,,,,,,

Delivery failures which were avoidable. We had to wait over an hour past fitment time and when they’d remove the front tyres they discovered one of the new ones had been damaged in transit so they old tyre had to go back on followed by another 2 day wait. Things like this can happen but it has put me off using this route. Ultimately why wasn’t the tyre checked on delivery and couldn’t we have been told the pre-booked time was unachievable in advance? This two thins would’ve mitigated the sour taste now left.,delivery punctuality negative,wait time negative,damage negative,booking confusion negative,,,,,,,,,,

But, my computer stated that the tyres where under inflated and the dust caps on the valves were missing.I had to re inflate to the correct pressures.Also, i went back to the fitter who stated that their systems were calibrated.I think that this was a sloppy operation and should not happen on such a mundane task.Sending vehicles out on to the highway in such a maner could end in a tragedy.",garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were over £50 cheaper for a set of four tyres over anything in the Borders and even my usual supplier in Newcastle. I was a bit apprehensive about using ATS in Galashiels for the fitting but they were first class, they took their time to do it properly and exceeded my expectations of a national generic tyre outfit.

I have no fault with [REDACTED] ordering system or their availability of tyres however I do not feel that they properly inspect the standard of service being given by their garages. Twice recently I have had poor service from the garage who fitted the tyres.

As a result I will not be using that garage again for any purpose.,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Highly recommended. Recommend by my friend to try [REDACTED] . Choose premium quality tyre and price was cheaper than any other site .Paid and Selected garage within one mile radius of my home .Arrived 5 minute before and my slot was attended by staff straightaway.Waiting area was nice and comfy .Got both tyre done with alloygator in 1hts 20 minute .Other workshop charge extra to change tyre if you have alloygator .Welldone for fantastic work.,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very happy with the service given to me. I arrived 10 minutes early and the lads jumped straight on my car while I waited. I am very protective over my car as she’s my pride and joy so I did watch them from start to finish. It’s nice to see them do it by the book without using a nut gun. Thankyou. I went to a different garage later that day as I needed the fronts urgently and couldn’t wait for your delivery time and they used a nut gun and didn’t removed the old wheel weights before balancing. They also charged an extra £15 a tyre. Your team are great I will be using [REDACTED] in the future as of now.,garage service positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All went really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exactly as described and expected. Recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent service! Will use again for sure! A++,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful. Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel.

"Unfortunately, you can't beat their prices, but I've had some mixed experiences, and I'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole.1) I booked a fitted service for my wife's car, and was given a timed appointment, which was really inconvenient (no choice of times), so I called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone, followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day"", etc, etc. So I called the garage directly and explained that I'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir, come along for when we open, and we'll get you straight in""... did customer service actually speak with the garage, given how accommodating they were when I called, I doubt it!2) Different garage, and 4 tyres for my car... I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences.",length of fitting negative,ease of booking negative,garage service negative,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,,

"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.",booking confusion negative,ease of booking negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this. However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again.

I've got fed up spending £170 on tyres that wear out quickly or get non repairable punctures so decided to look at the budget tyre for my car.I purchased four for the price of two Original Continental tyres. And guess what the tread pattern is exactly the same as the Original tyres the noise rating and wet weather performance better. And my mpg has has increased from 37 to 40 mpg.The local home visit tyre fitter Gary was an excellent choice to.If you're local to Bedfordshire I highly recommended him too.,location positive,garage service positive,value for money positive,tyre quality positive,,,,,,,,,,

"I do like [REDACTED] as a means of choosing tyres, the process was easy to follow and I felt it gave me an informed choice. On reflection the choice of garage might have been better, they were very busy and it took 2 hours to fit my tyres and adjust the tracking. Having had 4 new tyres fitted, after a long journey I had a tyre pressure warning light display and on checking, my tyres were all over inflated to 45psi, I had to deflate them to the recommended 32psi.

"This was my first time trying [REDACTED].com. I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.",value for money positive,location positive,delivery punctuality positive,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ordered two Continentals for our VW Tiguan. Ordered on a Wednesday and was given a Friday appointment. Turned up on Friday and the tyres hadn't been delivered. [REDACTED] rearranged for the following Wednesday, but on the Tuesday they cancelled it and rearranged for Thursday then again to the Friday! Went through a few customer service employees who all said the tyres had been delivered and that the garage was at fault. We finally got someone who actually worked to get the problem sorted (Taylor). She got the tyres ordered on a next day delivery for us to finally get them fitted. She kept decent contact through out the time she dealt with it. Decent cost saving but was a hassle. The local fitter who fitted them was surprised and said he doesn't usually have trouble with [REDACTED] deliveries.

"I had shopped around for some tyres for my car and [REDACTED] are a similar price to that of a few other companies, however I thought I would give them a go on the basis I can order online and have them fitted at home or work making it much easier. It’s far from easy however. I had booked for a mobile fitter to come out to me (had to pay a surcharge for this of £6) on a Saturday which at that point was a week away, I selected a pm slot. No details were given not any confirmation as to when pm is other than after 12. I waited in all afternoon then the garage called me around 3pm and stated [REDACTED] had delivered 2 different tyres and therefore could no longer fit them. I called [REDACTED] and was on hold for 10mins before someone eventually admired the mistake. They apologised and said I would get some compensation and would arrive in 3/5 days. The tyres have since been fitted and 2 weeks on the compensation has not arrived. I try calling and always on hold for ages.

Other businesses prepared and adapted, [REDACTED] did not. They could have chosen to deliver the tyres to the fitting centre before the weather came, they had time to do this. Alternatively, they could have set their website not to accept fitting slots in the days immediately after the poor weather.

Tyres and [REDACTED] service and price was good . I didn't have confidence with the fitters. I asked them to torque the wheel bolts to 170NM. They said this was too tight but I insisted. I then watched them do the bolts up with an 'air gun' then apply the torque wrench to each bolt on each wheel but didn't see the wrench move before the toque (click) setting engaged suggesting that the 'air gun' had already done them up super tight. This is all well and good until I need to change a wheel at the side of the road and can't get the bolts undone without a breaker bar.,garage service negative,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, it took an hour and a half on the phone and eventually we had to re-order a different set of tyres and return the three tyres to a local garage (as they mucked up the collection of the other tyres) and at one point we had seven new tyres in our hallway (A smelly nuisance!)The phone operatives are very helpful, but this company needs to sort out it’s delivery.

I didn't want to pay the normal price as I had just had to buy one.The [REDACTED] Web site was easy to use and gave the option of a few budget tyres. I shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters. The fitting time came through which was not convenient so called [REDACTED] who quickly rearranged the time for me.Turned up and immediately the wheel was taken, the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot.

"Kind of feel strange leaving this review since I purchased from them based on the Truspilot's generally great feedback for this company...The appointment cancelled by a text. Alright, I thought.. this happens... The cancellation text followed by a polite email from one of their representatives... - 'We are working on it' etc.... Good, they are taking care of it... Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages). You normally get a pretty decent customer service nowadays and its KEY to build good reputation for online retailers. Not good.*********************Hi TomI am really sorry for this issue.No, you are not. You don't care and only leave this comment here to make it look as if you care.

"I have used [REDACTED] several times, in three different Fitting Garages with excellent results. Easy to order, easy to pay and great communications from the company. Unfortunately, my latest experience was married slightly by the Tyre Fitting Garage having an attitude that made me feel like I was in the way. The fitter spent 10 minutes on his mobile phone in the middle of the job and when I asked the Receptionist if they would swap the tyres ""front to back and back to front"" I was told there would be a charge of £6.99 per wheel, despite the car already being raised to fit two new tyres.

The only reason I’ve given them 4 stars is due to how difficult it is to reach their customer services, by email only in my experience which goes to a central mailbox, once it’s there you are dealt with - not necessarily with the same person throughout the query and it took a couple of days to settle my query with emails going back and forth - but it does get sorted. But in my experience you just can’t get through over the phone which for me was just a little frustrating and meant my query settlement took days instead of being sorted in one phone call.

I tried to phone, to receive a message saying that they were so busy, unless it was an emergency, please phone back later. I then decided to send an email, to which I’ve still had no response. So I phoned again, only to receive exactly the same message, but they were so busy, but couldn’t talk to me, and could iPhone back.So I had paid for my tires, they had been delivered, but I was struggling to get them fitted.

I left my contact details and was assured that it would be ready by lunch time . I heard nothing, so turned up at 2pm expecting new tyres on my car , however it hadnt been moved at all . At reception they apologised cos they just didnt have time to do my car, but they would have it done by 2.30 . I finally got my car with new tyres at 3.30 pm , some 5 hours after i left it. Despite leaving my contact details i never had a call forwarning me of any delay . [REDACTED] did deliver on time but were severly let down by your fitting parner .

Day later got email with time I was expected at fitters. Emailed back to say that I couldn’t do the time given due to work and that 4:30 to 6pm would be best if possible. Email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot. Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back. The next day I was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off. Went to another garage over weekend who got it off. Took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem.

"I had my tyres fitted by one of the approved garages, Formula One, in Newport Pagnell. The tyres were fitted, no problem, but when returned to my car the drivers seat was dirty. I went straight to the office to say it looked like they had sat in the car in dirty overalls. He came and looked at the seat and asked me where the mark was and I said it was all over. He acted like he couldn't see anything but it was obvious that the seat was dirty. He also said that their staff always put a cover on the seat. He did ask if I wanted them to vacuum the seat and I declined and asked if I could have a protective cover for the seat and I would sort it out myself. I was not happy with the way I was treated like I was seeing things and do not feel my complaint was handled correctly. I will not be using them again.

"Why not try to experience great money saving adventure for choosing right tyres with reasonable comparison with other top branded products. I like the option for tyres and details for picking exactly right choice considering this and that. However, the fitting time took more than 1hour even if it seems simple to work. The reason was my car was abandoned more than 30 minutes as the priority of their work was not mine. It could be the only problem of joint business with other garage. But I was so happy that I fully enjoy the new tyres.",length of fitting negative,wait time negative,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bloke who fitted the tyres was great - turned up on time - knew his stuff - no problem at all there.They quote an all-inclusive price for fitted tyres so I was a bit niggled to find that when their website advertises X% off it means X% off the tyres and 0% off the fitting (even though they don't actually split the price between tyres and fitting) so it cost me a couple of pounds more per tyre than it led me to believe. Yes, I know what it says in the (very) small print but when it says ""discount"" in size 60 font and ""subject to terms and conditions"" in size 6 font and you can only find the terms and conditions in the bottom of locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a notice on the door saying ""beware of the leopard"" it doesn't quite give the impression that you'd expect of a straightforward business.

"Purchased two new Michelin run-flat tyres and selected a fitting date with my local garage all through the [REDACTED] website securing a great deal with a 10% flash sale discount. However, a day before the fitting I was told the tyres were not available and offered a pair of Pirelli’s for the same price. I would have liked the option of my preferred Michelin not available at time of the purchase or not available on the website. As I wanted the Michelin I declined and opted for a refund. This did not materialise within the 3-5 days. A quick email after that period fixed that problem and money back in account 3 days later. It happens. Definitely will use [REDACTED] again as their a great company. As for the fitter they were fine but took ages to fit the two tyres. I dropped car off at 8am and earliest I could get it was 2pm.

"Pretty poor experience overall. [REDACTED] delayed my tyres by a few days beyond when it was agreed they would be fitted. When tyres were eventually fitted they were the wrong size and having driven my car, I damaged my two alloys. Nothing was offered by way of compensation other than the meaningless ‘sincere apologies’. They did offer to fix my alloys and have them them re cut (which I have to organise and submit quotes etc) but nothing else. When the correct tyres were due to be fitted they again delayed the order and I’m hoping (but not holding my breath) that the correct tyres will be fitted tomorrow. I’ve had my car sitting in my drive for several days waiting for [REDACTED] to rectify their error. I hoped putting a customer out by a week might concern them but it really doesn’t. In summary they put themselves forward as a friendly, quirky service with their customer servers and personal bios stating they live in Edinburgh and enjoy watching TV, spending time with family and hillwalking. While they enjoy things like this, it’s pretty clear they don’t give one care about providing a good service and carrying out a simple task such as delivering and fitting a tyres. I will never be using them again. If you live in the Highlands just go anywhere else, regardless of the cost.

"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order.

I booked my tyre change for a complete set of tyres for an Aston Martin DB9. The appointed garage was excellent and the service was superb. My complaint is that the tyres I received were date stamped 2017 therefore were at least 2 years old. Upon complaining about this to [REDACTED] directly I was informed that these tyres are not pressed often and therefore up to date tyres could not be guaranteed. Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres.

The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable. Unfortunately I can't say this about [REDACTED] at this point in time.If you are pushed for time I would rather recommend going to a local garage and pay the premium but get your tyres done the same day.,ease of booking positive,delivery punctuality negative,change of date negative,refund negative,refund timescale negative,garage service positive,,,,,,,,

"on this occasion [REDACTED] let me down, numerous other times they have been outstanding. by not communicating with me I would have been left waiting for my tyres and would have lost money through no work.

My problems started when the partner garage (Auto Pfect at Wath on Dearne) could not accommodate me on the date I booked on line and I therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend. The tyres seemed to be fitted fine but I had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car. A few days later I took my car to the Kia dealership for mot and service. The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage. I certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main Kia dealer.",delivery punctuality positive,change of date negative,garage service negative,refund positive,,,,,,,,,,

"All in all a great service. There was a little confusion on the expected delivery times of my new tyre to my local garage. This confusion was caused by mixed messages in the emails from [REDACTED]. One email said that the tyre was going to be late and I needed to rearrange which I did. Then another email said the tyre would now not be late and the original time slot was still available. But I was not aware of this update until it was too late to confirm. A third email confirmed a new time slot -for a date that was yesterday! Obviously I challenged this and they then corrected the mistake. In the end the tyre change went well, no hiccups in the garage. Would still use [REDACTED] again, just wish for more clarity and less confusion in future.",change of date negative,delivery punctuality negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ok, so, no attempt was made to cover up the seats or floor despite the fitter getting in my beautifully clean car wearing dirty clothes and muddy boots. The waiting room was filthy, you would walk out dirtier than when you walked in. Despite paying £250.00 for my tyres, a coffee whilst waiting still cost £1.00. When fitted, I was urged to sign the paperwork to confirm that I'd been offered a look at the car post fitting to make sure I was happy, but hadn't. no attempt was made to remove the mud that was now in my car and dust that was on the seats and other places after fitting.I would use [REDACTED] again , but will avoid this fitting centre at all costs.",garage service negative,facilities negative,wait time negative,,,,,,,,,,,

Regardless of whether he thought they were (which they are!!) I don’t see the problem? They also said one of the wheels was corroded so required a bead seal. I’m not entirely sure it was but I got charged an extra £24 for the privilege. They also damaged the wheel while putting on one of the new tyres. I think they disturbed an old kerb repair but again their mentality was one of complete denial. I won’t be using this service again.

Tyre wasn’t delivered in time for fitting. The next fitting appointment was then cancelled.

Tried to order run flat tyres took 3 calls to the call centre to get a choice then when the garage had fitted the tyres they then found out that the tyres that were delivered were not run flat and had to go through the call centre again to get the tyres re-ordered and re book the fitting.

"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.",wait time negative,garage service positive,advisor/agent service negative,ease of booking negative,,,,,,,,,,

Let down so badly - I wish I did not have to give this review even 1 star as they are not worth it.They Emailed me at 17.17 last night saying they could not fit my tires the following day as already arranged. (They close at 17.30). I was traveling 5000 miles round trip the following day and my tires would become illegal during that time so urgently needed them done.They never responded to my email and I was on hold in a phone que for 35 minutes. Got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer.The only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus £30 and a 10% discount on future purchases. The extra £30 did not even cover the additional costs that I incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options.. Now trying to find new tyres (not easy in North of Scotland) instead of doing all the other things I had planned for today in prepartion for travelling abroad.Disgusting for such a big company to leave me stranded like this.,discounts negative,call wait time negative,late notice negative,refund positive,discounts positive,advisor/agent service positive,response time negative,,,,,,,

I couldn't take a pressure reading so something was affecting the valve. The valve was fiddled with and I was told to come back the next day when Phil was there.Contacted [REDACTED] CS and was told I'd get a quick callback.However all I got was an email on the Tuesday with all the reasons why a TPMS might fail and to go to the garage.On returning on Tuesday Phil was there, straight away removed the tyre, and it was clear the TPMS must have been damaged during the fitting and then shearing whilst driving at motorway speeds.

They then took much longer than I have ever waited for 2 tyres to be fitted, whilst most of the people were standing chatting in the garage, my tyres just sat in the corner for a good portion of the time. There were other cars in, but no other people in the waiting area. I had booked my car in for a tracking assessment online with a view to get the tracking realigned aswell. They then told me after an hour, they had no time to check my tracking, so I went and had this done elsewhere.

Although these type of centres tend to be very male dominated and slightly intimidating, particularly for females, this one was an extreme example of it’s type.

"I've bought several motorcycle tyres from [REDACTED] and always thought the service and value were good.However the front of the pair of motorcycle tyre I bought on the last occasion was defective. The tyres were fitted and balanced by my very experienced tyre man but I discovered that at speeds over 45mph the handlebars oscillated and this worsened until by 60mph it was unbearable. Tyre man removed, refitted and rebalanced the tyre but problem remained. Tyre man spotted that the tyre did not run true, the carcass was distorted. Tyre man fitted an old tyre and all was well, thus proving the new tyre was faulty. This was reported to [REDACTED] and they replaced the tyre and took the defective tyre for analysis.

Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved.

[REDACTED] themselves are really good and reliable but I would suggest they need to review some of the garages that they use for the fitting.

Having had the new tyres, when I reached 70mph on the motorway, I had steering wheel vibration. I assumed that there needed to be an adjustment with the balancing. I rang up and arranged to take the car back with no problems. ""Tommy""went to check the off side front wheel first, and then changed his mind and did the near side. It was slightly out. He then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine, he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do. He showed me the buckle and asked if I had hit a pot hole. (I had not) It was almost as if he knew what he was going to find. Somehow, it did not add up and I am now having to get the wheel straightened or at worst, get a new one.",damage negative,balancing negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

The garage had problems on the day our tyres were due to be fitted.

"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use.",mobile fitter negative,delivery punctuality negative,no stock negative,advisor/agent service positive,,,,,,,,,,

Used many times before but never again. Ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date. Got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time. Arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived. Rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime. Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day. Tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the [REDACTED] tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered.

"I have previously used [REDACTED] a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again. Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

"I made the booking to ensure my tyres were fitted at a time convenient for me prior to my MoT. Less than 24hours before my time slot I was emailed to be told that [REDACTED] wouldn’t be able to honour my booking and had rebooked me for 2 days later, after my MoT. As this was unacceptable I phoned up to find out why the booking had to be rescheduled. I was told that only one of my tyres was available and I then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to negotiate getting an alternative solution so as to make my MoT booking. Ultimate [REDACTED] couldn’t honour my booking and I had to reschedule my MoT to a time after their estimated delivery date of the other tyre.

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",value for money positive,garage service negative,damage negative,damage negative,,,,,,,,,,

They had to ring around 2 other local garages before they could find me another garage that would fit me in 2 days later than my original appointment. Although this may not have been [REDACTED] fault this was very stressful for me as my car had already failed the MOT hence why I booked my car in ASAP!

"I found the staff at BC.com very polite and helpful and BC themselves were/are one of the cheapest online tyre suppliers. My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land-rover, when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn’t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn’t take place. As it was a home fitting I’d taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did I want to proceed”.Livid???? Just a tad.I called BC but by then they’d closed for the day, so rang first thing the next day. Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I’d ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and BC didn’t know when they’d get some in. Great!!!Bottom line is a tyre was sourced (in Spain), and was eventually fitted the following Wednesday. Three weeks this took to complete.My advice would be make sure BC either have or can immediately source the tyres you’ after before committing to the deal.",change of date negative,value for money positive,no stock negative,advisor/agent service positive,delivery punctuality negative,,,,,,,,,

2 really friendly/ professional lads fitted Avon ZZ5’s to front wheels of car. They were really careful not to damage the (as yet unscathed) alloy wheels. Tyres feel much much better than the (frankly) awful Pirelli P Zeros that were on the car from new and were scrubbed after only 7500 miles.....even when new they felt skittish in the wet esp. the new Avon’s are quieter and offer way more grip (too early to discuss wear).

So here is the message I sent: ""Not a great experience today. I had my Passat booked in for a new pair of rear tyres at 8am at Tesco Bar Hill. I arrived at 7:55 as your instructions say. Your technician showed up at 8:10 with no apology or explanation. I gave him my keys, he said it would take around half an hour. 20 minutes later at 8:30 he phoned me to say he couldn’t find my locking nut, I explained where it was (in the tyre-change kit…not a particularly obtuse place for it to be located?), he still couldn’t find it. I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn’t have time to rummage through people’s stuff. I submit that if he’d shown up on time he’d have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff. He was finished at 9am, so the whole process took over an hour.I received the reminder text of my appointment at 9:37am, having already returned home!"".There you go [REDACTED], are you happy you bombarded me with requests to be reviewed now?",length of fitting negative,advisor/agent service negative,wait time negative,length of fitting negative,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,

"The only problem I had which was new to me was the tyre fit. I'm not sure it was prominent enough on the website and I'm not sure what difference it makes (other than price) but I originally ordered a Mercedes fit tyre for my Jag and I had to re-order and wait some time. It might be advisable if a check could be made for a car make & tyre match where ""fit"" is important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2x Bridgestone Potenza S001 285/30R19 Merc OnlyPROS:1) (easily) Best fitted price available anywhere2) Fitted at a local trader I know3) Customer Service was excellent in fixing a problem with the orderCONS:NONE!I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS. I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place!

"My first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly, I did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase, unfortunately the fitter I had used before was busy so I chose another local one all seemed great.Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size, fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre.I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time, I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made, I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund.I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain, I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain, I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch.I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date. obviously I would have to pay the difference.An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact, 5 hours later I got another email (this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting)the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really? why on earth would anyone want that? again they are not reading emails, I responded correcting the mistake.The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day, I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes.I sent another email asking for urgent contact.Hours later still nothing.I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours.They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened, I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me.The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous.It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills.When it works it really works, when something goes wrong it can be a challenge.",call wait time negative,location negative,garage service positive,response time negative,advisor/agent service negative,,,,,,,,,

"The tyres were fitted at one of your centres (Bathwick Tyres, Weymouth, Dorset), where we were treated with indifference, as though we were being nuisances for being there. We did not receive an invoice, the valve dust caps were not refitted after the new tyres had been fitted. Shockingly, the workmanship was downright dangerous as the wheel nuts on both wheels had not been tightened, I was able to remove them with my fingers after checking for a clonking noise from the front of the car which turned out to be caused by the wheels moving on the studs due to the wheel nuts coming undone.",garage service negative,damage negative,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cant fault [REDACTED] but pick you fitter carefully as Jeffreys tyres in Warrington who I picked were poor.

I said i booked Am and was told they dont do appointments. Do i sail i will return at 12 and was again told they dont do appointments.

"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.",value for money positive,garage service negative,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ABSOLUTELY USELESS[REDACTED] have possibly the worst booking system I’ve ever come across. I selected a local garage on Saturday 23 March at 9am and received confirmation of this appointment. When I arrived at the garage, at the booked date and time, the garage told me my appointment was for 10am the day before. Cut a long story short, the garage told [REDACTED] they were unable to fit me in at 9am on Sat 23 March, but they could do 10am on Fri 22 March. That’s fine, however [REDACTED] neglected to inform me of this and I had to rearrange my entire weekend plans. The garage was able to fit me in on the Sunday morning, however myself, my daughter and my parents had to change our entire weekend plans to accommodate this. Also, my wife bought a tyre through the [REDACTED] website, using the correct reference details and [REDACTED] sent the wrong tyre to the garage. My wife has now had to wait a week for [REDACTED] to issue the correct tyre and the garage to have the availability to fit her in.I would not use or recommend [REDACTED] to anyone.

"I’ve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco (very professional tyre-fitting) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old (but 80,000) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago. Chose Kumho’s as I’d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7’s(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon’s put on the kids’ cars, so consequently wouldn’t touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don’t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day!”. I don’t care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-“Park”. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”, inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”, don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where’s the spec is 110, don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it’s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They’ve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It’s a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not £150 on 2...

"I had a fast puncture and needed a new tyre to match my existing fitted on my drive as I had no spare and no jack. [REDACTED].com were competitively priced for the tyre and the mobile fitting charge was only £5. A self employed local tyre fitter arrived on the scheduled date with my tyre and he was professional and courteous. I usually use Kwik-Fit for Tyres but I'd have no hesitatation in using [REDACTED].com in future and the mobile fitting service saved me time, hassle and petrol.",mobile fitter positive,value for money positive,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good deal no fuss fitting would recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mobile fitter didn't turn up on Saturday. No notification from [REDACTED]. Phoned the fitter directly who said that they haven't received the tyres yet and were expected on Tues. Rescheduled for Weds at 9am. Didn't turn up again. Phoned to chase and then turned up at 3pm.,mobile fitter didn't arrive negative,delivery punctuality negative,change of date negative,wait time negative,,,,,,,,,,
Will never buy from [REDACTED] again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find [REDACTED] very easy to buy from. The tyres I needed were sold at a reasonable price. I chose to use a garage to fit them and they were delivered to the garage on time and in perfect condition. I've used [REDACTED] 4 times now and I will use them again next time I need tyres for mine or my wife's cars.,value for money positive,delivery punctuality positive,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent and friendly service communication perfect all ou have to do is turn up at your chosen fitting station and everything is ready for you with no waiting,wait time positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Purchased 4 tyres to be fitted (at Lavender Motors in Haywards Heath). Car returned, one tyre with dangerously low air pressure. Asked the garage to top up the tyre and check the other three. They did top up the one tyre but didn't bother to check the others. When I checked the tyres 10 minutes later all four tyres had varying pressures (from 29 to 37.5). I emailed both companies and have not received an apology from either. I will never use Lavender Motors again (they shouldn't be in business) and likely not [REDACTED].com either.,garage service negative,tyre quality negative,response time negative,advisor/agent service negative,,,,,,,,,

Only gripe was being asked to sign the 'acceptance form' at the garage without an opportunity to check the job. So I had to ask to see the tyre fitting was ok (no damage to alloys) before signing off the job. All was fine.,garage service positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
